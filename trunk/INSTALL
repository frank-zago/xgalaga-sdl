If you've installed XGalaga before v2.0, forget what you learned.
With XGalaga 2.0, GNU autoconfigure is used.  This means that most
people should be able to do:

./configure
make
make install

and be done. Make sure to have root privileges for make install.

  You may want to look at config.h after running configure and change
some of the options.

*** You can probably stop reading now and give it a shot.  Read on
*** if you have trouble.  Also make sure to read README.SOUND if
*** you are on something other than a Linux, FreeBSD or Sun machine.

--> You need xpmlib!  If you don't have it already, you can get it
    from ftp.x.org:/contrib/libraries.  If your libXpm is in a
    non-standard location, you will need to give the location to
    configure with --with-xpm-lib=DIR.

--> XGalaga is known to work on the following platforms:
	Linux
	AIX
	HPUX
	SunOS
	Solaris(?)
	Ultrix
	SGI
	FreeBSD
    If yours isn't listed, let me know!
    However, I've only tested Linux since the switch to autoconf.
    Please send me a patch if you have to do anything to make it compile.

--> Sound now works on Linux, FreeBSD, and Suns with native support,
    and NAS support is provided for others.  See README.SOUND for
    details, or if you just want to charge ahead and try it,
    then change NAS_SOUND in the Imakefile to be #defined (instead
    of #undef'd) For systems with native support, you shouldn't
    need to change anything.

  As distributed, the images are compiled in to images.c, so you don't
need the images directory.  images.c and images.h are created
automatically by "mkimgsrc"; if you change any pixmaps, you will have
to rerun mkimgsrc to update images.c and images.h
