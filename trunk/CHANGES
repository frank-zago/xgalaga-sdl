Changelog for xgalaga
=====================
Version 2.1.01.0 (HR 2008/03/05)
- Updated configure.in and Makefile.in for building an new configure
  script and Makefile with BSD support (autoconf -o configure configure.in).
  The goal is to build on supported platforms 'out of the box'. If there 
  is anything to do, please let me know at
   tshe_hermann remove_this at web dot de
- Added scrolling credits in the title screen. Therefore increased 
  the third paragraph of the version number.

Version 2.1.00.2 (HR 2008/02/11)
- Changed numbering scheme to a dotted style to become better compatibility 
  with distro's numbering scheme.
- Fixed broken sound. xgal.sndsrv.linux opens /dev/dsp now with O_WRONLY.
  This makes simultaneously playing oggs working.
- Added man page (content and build handling). Added <s> and <Q> key. 
   
Version 2.1.00-1 (HR 2008/02/07)
- added ifdefs in score.c for compiling with no sound support
- added file mkinstalldirs. Needed by make install

Version 2.1.00-0 (HR 2008/02/06)
- This release is mainly a bugfix relase. Some of them are years old. 
  See hints below.
- added the xgalaga_2.0.34-44.diff from debian. Thanks to Joey Hess for
  collecting all these stuff over the years. 
  Main changes are: compiling xgalaga-hyperspace, full screen mode, security
  fixes for HOME-Variable and global score file, joystick support, 
  improvements of sound server, new weapons machine gun and spread shot, ....
- Bugs as reported at sourceforge Request ID 1394882 "make error on fc4 64-bit"
  and 1167157 "make error on FC3" are supposed to be fixed. Changed the order
  of header files in several .c files. I have no 64 bit system to test this, 
  but I got the same error on ubuntu 7.10
- Debian bug report #149743: "xgalaga starts when i want to turn sounds off" is
  fixed. In fact, it started on any key except <q> or <Q>. Now starts only on
  the keys <k> and <m> as stated in the last line on the title screen. 
  Turning sound off works during the game and at the title screen. For clarity
  there is now a 'Q' (=quiet) right from the level, which appears, when sound
  is switched off.
- Debian bug report #60266: "Too slow when sounds are not available" is 
  probably fixed. I could not exactly reproduce the bug. On my box, xgalaga 
  crashes totally. Maybe it depends on the sound system. I added the evaluation
  of the returncode on writing to /dev/dsp. The crash was gone away.
- Debian bug report #399987 "xgalaga -level accepts ""impossible to loose"" 
  levels" is partially fixed. The -level parameter value is cut to 15. Higher
  levels are still avalable by playing (good luck).
- Added a couple of additional key codes. The <p> (pause) and <s> (toggle 
  sound) did not work, because they produce key codes increased with 256. 
  Editing the high score name also didn't work on the same reason.
- Added bugfix for "[1837041] Fix seg fault" as reported on sourceforge
- Changed order of libs in configure.in. This (and some other improvements) 
  makes xgalaga compile under Cygwin/X
 

===== Notes below by Joe Rumsey (changed order from bottom to top (HR)) ====

v2.0.34 Fixed the sound server string allocation bug submitted by
           everyone and their mother.  D'oh.  
    Also in sound server, changed an fd <= 0 to fd < 0.
        (pointed out by Isaac To <kkto@cs.hku.hk>)
    Changed a library order problem that caused problems for
        some people.  Don't know why.
    Added -level command line option to start at any given level
        (submitted by Bill Kawakami <billk@rogers.wave.ca>)
    Fixed levels 9 and 12.  The conversion to the new level file
        format wasn't quite perfect. (Also pointed out by Bill K.)
    Changed "mkinstalldirs" in Makefile.in to "./mkinstalldirs" for
        people who (quite sensibly) don't have . in root's path.
    Pressing a key to start the game starts in keyboard mode, pressing 
        a mouse button starts in mouse mode.  It used to be this way,
        I don't know when it broke.
    Turned off the cheat mode.  Not s'posed to be on in the source I
        ship.  Oops.
    Changed install dirs to /usr/local/lib/xgalaga/*, /usr/local/bin/xgalaga
        in keeping with where things installed "by hand" should go.
	Package maintainers - if you need any additional support from
        me to make getting your packages in the right directories,
        please let me know.

v2.0   I moved again! Addresses changed.
    Level descriptions are now read from human readable(sorta ;) text files.
        Adding new levels is MUCH easier now.
    Gets much harder as the level increases.
    Now uses GNU Autoconfigure
    Doesn't crash if sound support is installed but no sound hardware present

1.4a   bug that caused segfaults on hpux(and likely others, I don't
    know why I didn't run into it actually) fixed.

v1.6c   I moved, addresses (both snail and email) changed.
    Added kludge for a bug(?) in recent linux kernels with only the PC speaker.
        #define PCSP_ONLY in the Imakefile if that describes your system AND
        sound doesn't work otherwise.
    Added #defines for Solaris in xgal.sndsrv.sun.c for bzero and bcopy
    Added a patch from Martin Eskildsen to make the entry positions work
        if WINWIDTH and WINHEIGHT are redefined.  (Compile time option,
        doesn't mean you can scale the window!)
    Enemy torp speed now increases every five levels, instead of 15.
    Thought seriously about doing 5 more levels and some other stuff
        and making this v1.7.  Maybe soon.  So many ideas, so little
        time.

v1.6b   Single bug fix, on some systems (SGI and Linux ELF notably) the game just
      froze when you started it.  It was just an unitialized variable.

v1.6    Added high score hacks from Bill Clarke <bill@discworld.anu.edu.au>
          compile time option NOSCOREHOGS changes the high scores to allow
          only one high score per uid.  Note that you will have to
          erase any existing *global* score file to use this mod.  The
          personal score files are still ok.
          Also, -scores option on the command line prints out the
          score table and exits.
    Ship display shows the number left when > 6 ships
          remain. (also from Bill, them aussies is GOOD!)
    Gets harder every 15 levels.  people getting near (past?)
          level 200 is really disgusting, stop it!  (The guy that
          wanted a save game option was the last straw ;)  May need to
          be harder still, I'll think up something more fiendish for 1.7
    Added Imakefile defs for Solaris (-DUSE_LRAND48 was apparently needed.

v1.5a   Added Sun and NAS sound support, thanks to Paul Kendall.
      NAS should work on ANY system with NAS installed.

v1.5    15 levels
    Aliens will not attack until all waves have entered. (You're 
      welcome, Rick.)
    Fixed for TrueColor and Mono displays. (XStoreColor causes them
      to crash - just removed the color cycling on the high
      scores for those displays).  Also, no more strange colored
          squares around objects on TrueColor displays.  There may
      still be invisible ships on mono displays - this is a
      problem with libXpm translating sprites with all dark
          colors into all black sprites.  Solution: draw brighter
      sprites.

v1.4    changed x11window.c into libXsprite.  Very few code changes, just
      took a chainsaw to it and spilt it into manageable chunks.
    new alien types, new levels, new prizes (HINT: not every effect
      of a prize need be immediately apparent.  Looking at the source
      is cheating ;-)
    grabs the pointer intelligently - only when using the mouse to play,
      and only when actually playing.  Ungrabs at the title screen
      and when paused.
    tiny (3x3) mouse pointer
    Compile option to automatically insert the user's real name
      into the high score list.  (Also fills it in as the default
      if prompting for a name) look in the Imakefile to turn this on
    Help info on title screen, scoring info gone(because the ships
      change from level to level now)
    Other minor bugs fixed.
    Lots of tweaks for difficulty

v1.3a   Took out the $@#!%^ usleep entirely.  select should be fine on
    everyone's system.

1.3    added personal high scores, expanded global to 20 places
    reloads high scores before checking/adding a score (in case
      someone else made the list)
    compiles clean with -Wall
    title page cycles through info
    sped up aliens during entry phase.  Bit of a kludge to keep
      the paths I have defined already working about the same, but
      no one but me is likely to care ;-)

vv1.2a   FreeBSD works for real
    Imakefile had CDEBUGFLAGS set for my machine. oops.
    forgot to #ifdef a coupld of play_sound()'s.  oops.

v1.2    Shrunk window to 400x500 (Was 400x600)
    Started adding Galaga style entrance paths
    Changed name to XGalaga
    Bonus pods, weapon upgrades
    SOUND!  For Linux and FreeBSD anyway.  Bug Sujal for others.
    added some command line switches 
    changed default controls to keyboard.

v1.1    Added an Imakefile
    pressing button no longer restarts game while entering a high
        score.
    Added info to title screen.
    #ifdef'd out the cheat keys.  #define IM_A_BIG_FAT_CHEATER
    to get them back :)
    added patches for AIX, HPUX, SUNOS, ULTRIX, thanks to
    Johnathan Hardwick for all of them!
    Added keyboard controls

v1.0  5/11/95 first public release
