  Please see the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

  This is the first game I've written for X from "scratch" (the
graphics interface is borrowed, I wrote everything else), but is by no
means my first game.  I have written several popular shareware games
for the Amiga, and plan to start porting them to X.  This project is
to help me get used to X and to fine tune the graphics routines to
make the next project easier.

  Previous versions of this game were released as shareware.  However,
it was never really worth my while.  Therefore, with apologies to the
good souls that sent their payments in, I have placed it under the GNU
GPL.  See COPYING for details

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.


Command line options:
  -scores              Print out the high score tables and exit
  -nosound             Turn sound off on platforms with sound support

  <anything else>      print usage and version.

Basic instructions:
  It's Galaga, you know how to play Galaga, stop bothering me.
  (Ship follows the mouse, button fires.  Auto-fire by holding it
   down, so no-one accuses me of breaking their mouse!)

Keyboard commands:

  p - pauses
  q - end this game
  s - toggle sound if your system supports it
  m - Turn mouse control on     (also works to start the game)
  k - Turn keyboard controls on (also works to start the game)
      Controls: left_arrow  - move left
        right_arrow - move right
        space_bar   - fire
